Solar System Outline
  Center: Sun (fixed at the origin, rotating in place)
  Orbital rings: Planets
    Each planet has its own orbital radius and own orbital speed
    Follow circular path around the sun
      r cos (theta), r sin (theta)
    Planets also have their own y-axis rotation
    Shading (and shadows?)
  Offset orbital: reflective rocket ship (ray tracing)
    Rocket ship moves on its own orbit, separate from the planets
  
  Camera modes:
    Select between camera locked onto rocket ship (3rd person) 
                   manual camera controls using WASD + Mouse
    Rocket remains on its predefined trajectory regardless
      (Camera does NOT affect rocket)
  
  Every render call:
    Planets advance in orbit and rotation (spin) and calculates shadows
    Rocket advances in orbit and calculates ray traced reflections
